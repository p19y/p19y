### ðŸ‘‹ Hey baby, I'm p19y aka mate, aka mathieu (pick one)


I am a **Volunteer** at [LaCapsule.org](https://lacapsule.org) and a **Writer**. You should read some stories I published on [my personal website](https://spinning-fantasies.org) (mostly in French), cause I come from [Morlaix](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/297387), in North Western Britanny.

*Where I am working on:*

- I am **currently helping** [@LaCapsule](https://github.com/lacapsule) to fix some issues on [their website](https://lacapsule/V4) and grow their [computer refurbishing business](https://lacapsule.org/pages/metier.html#reconditionnement).
- I am a **proud member** of [La Maisons PerchÃ©e](https://www.maisonperchee.org/), an online mental health peer-to-peer support group.
- I am also a **part of** [L'Onda Nostra](https://www.ondanostra.com) and [Immersion Nomade](https://imno.in), which are both art collective.

*Where I used to work*

- I was a **Customer Support Agent** at [Side.co](https://www.side.co) from Winter 2017 to Summer 2018.
- I wrote an **auto fiction book** pompously entitled [NONLIVRE](https://github.com/p19y/p19y/files/10425447/NONLIVRE.2017.pdf) in 2017.
- I helped [Baptiste](https://github.com/baptistejamin) and [Valerian](https://github.com/valeriansaliou) to kickstart [Crisp](https://crisp.chat) in 2015.
